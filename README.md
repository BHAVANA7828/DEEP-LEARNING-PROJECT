DESCRIPTION:
CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN (TensorFlow)
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories such as Airplane, Cat, Dog, Ship, and Truck.
It is a deep learning computer vision project suitable for beginners and intermediate learners to understand image classification pipelines.

ðŸ“Œ Features :
Loads and preprocesses CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 32Ã—32 color images in 10 classes)
Builds a CNN with:
3 Convolutional layers (Conv2D)
2 MaxPooling layers (MaxPooling2D)
Dense layers for classification
Uses ReLU activation for hidden layers and Softmax for output
Trains for 10 epochs with accuracy tracking

Visualizes:
Training & Validation Accuracy over epochs
Predictions with correct/incorrect classifications highlighted
Achieves ~70% test accuracy
